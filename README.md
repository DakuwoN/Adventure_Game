## Overview
Adventure Game Project @ Udacity

The goal here is to create an adventure game.
The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
The game has conditions for winning and losing.
When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

## My process

I began by creating my repository through Git and then cloning to a remote repository on GitHub. Then, I used the import module twice, one for random, and the other for time. Next, I would create an array of strings, that would then be assigned to a variable. I created multiple functions, and conditional statements, along with print statements in order to build the game. Finally, I checked the user input with a valid input function. Testing was a common occurence during the building process. Once all of my testing passed, I had the game completed.

### Built with

Python 

### Continued development

I have come to enjoy Python more as my favorite programming language over JavaScript, but I enjoy both. I want to learn more with Python.
